# Python Subprocess Management
# subprocess — Subprocess management.
# The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
# This module intends to replace several older modules and functions:
#
# Using the subprocess Module.
# The recommended approach to invoking subprocesses is to use the run() function for all use cases it can handle.
# For more advanced use cases, the underlying Popen interface can be used directly.
#

#
# subprocess.run(args, *, stdin=None, input=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, capture_output=False, shell=False, cwd=None, timeout=None, check=False, 
# encoding=None, errors=None, text=None, env=None, universal_newlines=None):
# Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return a CompletedProcess instance.
#

#
# Popen objects are supported as context managers via the with statement: on exit, standard file descriptors are closed, and the process is waited for.
# 

with Popen(["ifconfig"], stdout=PIPE) as proc:

              log.write(proc.stdout.read())
